This calculator is written in C and designed to be run in Linux or MacOS. 
The GCC compiler should be used.
Python version 3.10 or newer is required.

Compiling Instructions:
1. Navigate to the folder containing calculator.c
2. In terminal, run "gcc *.c -o test_calculator -lm

Running Instructions:
1. In terminal, run "python3 expression_generator.py 1 1 10
	The first parameter is the number of valid expressions to be generated
	The second parameter is the number of invalid expressions to be generated
	The third parameter is the length of each expression to be generated

The final output of the Python program tells the length of the longest line in the CSV (expression+ , + expected result)
1. In command line or terminal, run "./test_calculator 1 1 15"
	The first parameter is the number of valid expressions to be generated
	The second parameter is the number of invalid expressions to be generated
	The third parameter is the maximum length of the longest CSV line.


ALTERNATE RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS
1. Open runScripts.sh
2. Modify the three variables at the top of the file to input the three parameters.
	The first parameter is the number of valid expressions to be generated
	The second parameter is the number of invalid expressions to be generated
	The third parameter is the length of each expression to be generated
3. In terminal, navigate to the folder path containing the project files. 
4. In terminal, run "chmod +x runScripts.sh". This gives the bash file executable permissions
5. In terminal, run "./runScripts.sh"
